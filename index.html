    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">The most efficient practices to prevent web security attacks are as follows:
        <ol>
        <li>Sanitization of data
        
            <p>This ensures that the data a system accepts is in the right format. This can be done manually or by using third-party solutions like NodeJS.</p></li>
        <li>Secure authorization and authentication
        
            <p>This practice ensures that authorization and authentication are hard to crack. This can be done manually but is best achieved using a framework such as OneLogin.</p></li>
        <li>CI/CD
            
            <p>This is an automated process of integrating and delivering code to production. If any changes don't pass the checks, they get rejected and flagged.</p></li>
        <li>Automatic user timeout
            
            <p>This protects users who have left their credentials open in the browser for a long time.</p></li>
    </ol>
